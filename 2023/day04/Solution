Explain in your own words and examples, what is Shell Scripting for DevOps:
Bash scripting is like having a personal bot for your command line. With just a few lines of code, you can have your computer do all the tedious tasks for you. 
Imagine, never having to manually move files around again or having to manually run updates. Bash scripting can do all that and more! Think of it as giving your computer a set of instructions, and it will follow them to a tee. 


What is #!/bin/bash? can we write #!/bin/sh as well?
#!/bin/bash, which is called a shebang. It is used to specify the interpreter that should be used to run the script. In this case, the interpreter is /bin/bash. This line tells the operating system that the script should be executed by the Bash shell.
It is also possible to use #!/bin/sh


Write a Shell Script which prints I will complete #90DaysOofDevOps challenge:
#!/bin/bash
echo "I will complete #90DaysOfDevOps challenge"


Write a Shell Script to take user input, input from arguments and print the variables.
#!/bin/bash
echo "Enter your name:"
read name
echo "Enter your age:"
read age
echo "Enter your location:"
read location
echo "name is $name, i am $age, and located in $location"


Write an Example of If else in Shell Scripting by comparing 2 numbers:
#!/bin/bash
echo "Enter first number:"
read num1
echo "Enter second number:"
read num2
if [ $num1 -gt $num2 ]
then
    echo "$num1 is greater than $num2"
elif [ $num1 -lt $num2 ]
then
    echo "$num1 is less than $num2"
else
    echo "$num1 is equal to $num2"
fi
