1️⃣ What is DevOps and its Importance?



DevOps = Development +operations

DevOps is a Streamline process where the code gets built, tested, reviewed, and deployed in an automatic way with no or low manual interference after being pushed into the SCM.

It is a Collaborative approach where all teams (development + Testing + Operations) come together to achieve a common goal, in this case, the deployment of code with zero downtime.



simpler terms: "साब का साथ सब का विकास"



2️⃣ What is Automation, Scaling, Infrastructure



Automation refers to achieving a goal with no manual intervention, 

Example: when a developer pushed a code to GitHub, it should get automatically built, tested, reviewed, and deployed over servers.



Scaling: The ability to function well even in high traffic or utilization.

there are multiple ways to achieve these like Kubernetes or VMSS (Virtual machine scale sets) in Azure.

Example: Hotstar's Ability to cater to the viewers on an India Vs Srilanka cricket match where the viewership is in millions vs India vs Pakistan T20 match where the viewership was record-breaking at a whopping number of 1.8 crores.



Infrastructure: in simpler words, all the hardware, software, and requirements that are responsible for your automation or deployment.

Examples: servers (computers), network appliances (routers, switches, NICs), Cloud hosted services (Azure, Aws), and Software like Jenkins and Maven.
